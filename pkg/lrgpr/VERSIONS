** Version 0.05 // August 20, 2013
 - Fail gracefully when input has NA values
 - Cross-validation works
 - standard linear and logistic models with formula in glm_batch
 - Fixed strange issue with lrgpr() that caused R to crash with nthreads was large
 


** Version 0.04 // August 7, 2013
 - Formula evaluation in lrgpr and lrgpr_batch

** Version 0.03a // May 1, 2013
 - Fixed calculation of Adjusted R-squared to fix an issue where it was greater than 1

** Version 0.03 // April 29, 2013
 - Fixed problem of non-symmetric variance-covariance matrix, so Wald test's work
   	 This is now symmetric and is of the same form as that from lm()

 - Fixed calculation of Rsq to use cor() directly
	 
 - Split some code in summary.lrgpr() into print.summary.lrgpr(), 
	so evaluating s = summary(fit) no longer prints to console
