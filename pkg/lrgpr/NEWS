v 0.0.4
  - specify columns of features to include/exclude from analysis glmApply() and lrgprApply()
  - lrgpr() and lrgprApply() now handle low rank SVD produced by svd()
  - lrgpr() is MUCH faster for large sample sizes
  - glmApply2() implements faster linear regression
  - Backend changes to processing of binary matrix data on harddrive
  - Faster cv.lrgpr() and criterion.lrgpr() by not computing right singular vectors
    - These return objects now compatible with plot()

v 0.0.3
  - graceful exit from glmApply/lrgprApply when response is empty

v 0.0.2
  - Add option to suppress progress bar
  - Throw error when sub.big.matrix is passed as features.  Only matrix and big.matrix are supported
